      <p class="card-text">With the aim to provide formal music education from the primary level onwards, Guitar Schoolk is the first school in Nepal to be assigned the task of developing a music curriculum by the Ministry of Education.
                                 With our curriculum approved up to class ten, staff and teachers at Guitar School are currently working on the development of a curriculum for higher studies in music.
                                Guitar School sees Eastern and Western pedagogies as complementary and relies on both to work towards an innovative instructional methodology. Our belief in “learning by doing” is evident in our teaching methods. 
                                School workshops, ensembles, and concerts are among the regular activities put on by Guitar School students and staff.</p>
